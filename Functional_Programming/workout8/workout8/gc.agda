{- (doMark u unmarked m b) is supposed to return (just v) if the address
   given by b is a member of unmarked, and v is the result of removing that
   address from unmarked.  If the address given by b is not in unmarked,
   then return none. This function simulates marking a cell by removing
   it (if it is there) from the vector of unmarked cells.  Because the
   length of the vector decreases, we can recurse in markh on the result
   if we need to.

   marked if they do not appear in unmarked, and you use outgoingPointers to update the worklist
   when it is time to recurse.
